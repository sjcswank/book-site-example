                <p>There is a distinct hint of Armageddon in the air. According
                    to <em>The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter,
                    Witch</em> (recorded, thankfully, in 1655, before she blew
                    up her entire village and all its inhabitants, who had
                    gathered to watch her burn), the world will end on a
                    Saturday. Next Saturday, in fact. So the armies of Good
                    and Evil are amassing, the Four Bikers of the Apocalypse
                    are revving up their mighty hogs and hitting the road,
                    and the world's last two remaining witch-finders are
                    getting ready to fight the good fight, armed with awkwardly
                    antiquated instructions and stick pins. Atlantis is rising,
                    frogs are falling, tempers are flaring. . . . Right.
                    Everything appears to be going according to Divine Plan.</p>

                <p>Except that a somewhat fussy angel and a fast-living demon -
                    each of whom has lived among Earth's mortals for many millennia
                    and has grown rather fond of the lifestyle - are not particularly
                    looking forward to the coming Rapture. If Crowley and Aziraphale
                    are going to stop it from happening, they've got to find and
                    kill the Antichrist (which is a shame, as he's a really nice
                    kid). There's just one glitch: someone seems to have misplaced
                    him. . . .</p>

                <h2>Terry Pratchett &amp; Neil Gaiman<small> (and Agnus Nutter)</small></h2>
                <p>In 1985 a young journalist interviewed and up and coming fantasy
                    novelist in a Chinese restaurant. It was the first interview
                    said novelist gave, and the begining of the story of how
                    Good Omens came to be. After that single interview, Gaiman and
                    Pratchett not only became co-authors of a much-loved cult
                    phemonenom, but good friends and one of the most dynamic duos
                    to have ever signed a book cover together. Their unique blend
                    of Classic English Humour (as Gaiman has termed it), horror,
                    and fantasy has propelled each of them to fame in their own
                    right, and combined into a novel that will make people laugh
                    and reflect for generations to come.</p>

                    reaches audiences of all ages. He is listed in the Dictionary

                <h3>About Terry</h3>
                <p>Terry Pratchett was born in 1948 in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire.
                    He had his first story published when he was just thirteen,
                    and after leaving school at seventeen to become a journalist
                    he continued writing, publishing his first novel, The Carpet
                    People, in 1971 and going on to produce the phenomenally
                    successful Discworld series as well as numerous other books,
                    winning many awards and becoming the UK’s bestselling author.</p>

                <p>In 2007 Pratchett was diagnosed with a rare form of Alzheimer’s,
                    Posterior Cortical Atrophy. He decided to tell the world,
                    and began his campaign to raise awareness of the disease,
                    donating a million dollars to Alzheimer’s research the
                    following year. He died in March 2015 after a long struggle
                    with the disease.</p>
